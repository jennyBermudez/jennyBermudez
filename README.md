### Hi there 👋
I'm an collegiate Economist, specialized in business economics and data analysis. I consider myself a proactive and creative person. I am interested in the world of data analysis (Excel, Power Bi, Tableau, Python) and I am still training in this sector.
I'm currently learning frontend development and I working on different projects for training it.
